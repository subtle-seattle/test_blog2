Not owning a car in a city like Seattle can make things a little difficult especially if you are keen on outdoor activities outside of the city. Even though there are some options to rent a car or worse, take a cab. But let’s be serious, no one wants to get out of their already expensive Zipcar AND buy a Discovery Pass for its parking!

So, if you’re one of those who does not want the stress of having to drive around on a weekend or simply get more time to doze off after a hike (Loooking at you, lazy bummer) – King County’s Trailhead Direct Transit system is just for you!

Be sure to keep a track of their seasonal service [here](https://trailheaddirect.org/).

My partner and I recently used the Trailhead Direct service to [Mount Si](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si) and hiked up to [Mount Teneriffe Falls](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/teneriffe-falls).

_Trailhead Direct provides this shuttle service every half hour from North Bend Park and Ride to the Little Si, Mount Si, and Teneriffe Falls trailheads. Service runs every half hour from Downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill Link light rail Station, and Eastgate Freeway Station in Bellevue. For exact information on bus stops and timings, please follow the link here._

**The Trailhead Direct Experience**

We live in the SLU area so the Downtown Stop (at Spring St & 5th Ave) seemed like the best option to board the bus. We reached the stop at around 8:20 am and being the only ones there – yes, we were doubting the existence of this bus service and were almost prepared to be fooled! But then, a couple of other hikers showed up and we realized, its not just us.

The bus arrived a few minutes over its planned scheduled time at around 8:50 am (no complaints, at all) and was very well maintained, clean, and pretty spacious for hiking gear, backpacks, etc.

Passing a canopy of pine wood trees on the I 90, we reached the North Bend in a little over half an hour, at the Mt Teneriffe Trailhead.

**On our way to hiking Mount Teneriffe Falls**

We started our hiking adventure at the Mt Teneriffe trailhead at around 10 am.

Restrooms are available at the trailhead.

We followed the Mount Teneriffe Road for nearly a mile to an intersection signed for Teneriffe Falls. This is the beginning of the new trail to the falls. Turn right at this junction and the route remains mellow in the first mile.

Most part of the trail is unexposed but I’d still recommend a sunscreen in the summer months. It feels like a walk in the woods, until it gets rocky and rocky!

You’ll gain 850 feet of the over the last 0.9 miles to the falls.

We went on a partly cloudy summer day and we were glad! It was fairly pleasant ‘cause oh boy, you’ll work up a good sweat till the time you think you’ve reached.

While my partner has been on quite a few hikes even he was surprised at the rocky road we had to navigate.

Make sure you are wearing hiking boots with a good grip. In case you aren’t, feel free to skip the rocky part of the hike as it can get pretty dangerous with loose rocks falling down.

Also, if you are hiking in the peak of summer, its quite possible that the falls have dried (BUMMER ALERT). 

Nevertheless you'll be greeted with sweet views of the Snoqualmie valley and the evergreen forest.

So, if you feel like you’ve had enough of a good view and ROCKS, don’t be shy to turn around and call it a day.

BECAUSE, the hike back to the trailhead can feel tougher than the hike up the mountain.

Of course, you can blame it on the low energy levels too but you’d be mistaken to take the okay-ish elevation gain lightly.
