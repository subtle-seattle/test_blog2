Not owning a car in a city like Seattle can make things a little difficult especially if you are keen on outdoor activities outside of the city. Even though there are some options to rent a car or worse, take a cab. But let’s be serious, no one wants to get out of their already expensive Zipcar AND buy a Discovery Pass for its parking!

So, if you’re one of those who could avoid the stress of having to drive around on a weekend or simply get more time to doze off after a hike (Loooking at you, lazy bummer) – King County’s Trailhead Direct Transit system can feel like a blessing!

This is a seasonal service and service timings can be tracked [here](https://trailheaddirect.org/).

Being without a car in Seattle is obviously no fun but my partner and I recently discovered the Trailhead Direct to [Mount Si](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-si) and hiked up to [Mount Teneriffe Falls](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/teneriffe-falls)!

_Trailhead Direct provides this shuttle service every half hour from North Bend Park and Ride to the Little Si, Mount Si, and Teneriffe Falls trailheads. Service runs every half hour from Downtown Seattle, Capitol Hill Link light rail Station, and Eastgate Freeway Station in Bellevue._

**The Trailhead Direct Experience**

We live in the SLU area so the Downtown Stop (at Spring St & 5th Ave) seemed like the best option to board the bus. We reached the stop at around 8:20 am and being the only ones there – yes, we were doubting the existence of this bus service AND were almost prepared to be fooled! 

But then, a couple of other hikers showed up and nope, we did not waste our weekend.

The bus arrived a few minutes over its planned scheduled time at around 8:50 am (no complaints, at all) and was very well maintained, clean, and pretty spacious for hiking gear, backpacks, etc.

Passing a canopy of pine wood trees on the I90, we reached the North Bend in a little over half an hour, at the Mt Teneriffe Trailhead. You'll also pass through Lake Washington and get a view of Lake Sammamish but all in all, its a **_super quick ride_** with no stops!

##### **HIKING STATS**

**DISTANCE: 6.3 miles**

**DIFFICULTY: Moderate**

**TOTAL ELEVATION GAIN: 1,624 feet**

**LENGTH OF TIME: 4 hours (including lunch stop)**

**BEST TIME TO VISIT: April through November**

**Hiking Mount Teneriffe Falls**

We started our journey at the Mt Teneriffe trailhead at around 10 am. The crowd was not so bad even for a busy trail on a Saturday morning.

The trail starts off with a gentle incline and lots of greenery for the most part.

After following the Teneriffe Road for nearly a mile, turn right at the intersection signed for Teneriffe Falls. This is the beginning of the new trail to the falls.

Most part of the trail is unexposed but I’d still recommend a sunscreen in the summer months.

It feels like a walk in the woods, until it gets rocky and rocky!

You'll gain an elevation of 850 feet in the last mile.

Make sure you are wearing hiking boots with good grip to keep your feet and ankles happy.

**Note:**  In case you aren’t wearing sturdy shoes, feel free to skip the rocky part of the hike as it can get dangerous with loose rocks, especially if it is rainy.

Also, if you are hiking in the peak of summer, its quite possible that the Falls have dried **(BUMMER ALERT)**.

We went on a partly cloudy summer day and we were glad. 

The weather was fairly pleasant ‘cause oh boy, you’ll work up a good sweat till the time you think you’ve reached!

So, if you feel like you’ve had enough of a good view and rocks, don’t be shy to turn around and call it a day. (We did see some wiser folks doing this)

The shot above was not exactly taken from the actual Teneriffe Falls viewpoint but from a point about half a mile on the way back. 

**Note:** Since we hiked in August, the fall was completely dry and hence, underwhelming. So, unless you're interested in huge rocks stacked upon one another - there isn't much there.

We spotted a great viewpoint on our way to the top, where we decided to put our feet down and munch on some snacks. 

Be sure to take frequent water/snack breaks BECAUSE the hike back to the trailhead can feel tougher than the hike up the mountain.

Of course, you can blame it on the low energy levels too but you’d be mistaken to take the okay-ish elevation gain lightly.

We'd blame it on the rocks!

**_All in all_** _- **Mount Teneriffe Falls gave us a better workout than we expected and a great practice hike for more to come!**_

###### **TIPS FOR THE BEST EXPERIENCE**

* Plan your hike in spring when the waterfall is at its peak and the trail has wildflowers!
* Hiking boots are a must
* Make sure you carry some electrolyte-based drinks and snacks
* Hikers have created a make-shift trail overlooking the Falls - a very steep path with lots of rocks to the summit of Mt Si. This is not the official path and is NOT reccomended.
