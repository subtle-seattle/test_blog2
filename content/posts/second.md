Home to some of the biggest tech titans, bustling restaurants, hip bars, quirky cafes, and mesmerizing waterfront views, South Lake Union truly embodies the heart of Seattle. Whether you are a newbie settling in or an old-timer planning to move to this part of the city, here’s everything you need to know to call South Lake Union, your little home.

**1. Access to Public Transportation**

Yes! You heard that right.

While access to public transit can be an issue in many areas around Washington, the SLU area is blessed with a myriad of reliable and frequent transit options to help you get around without a car.

One of the many perks of living in SLU (Read: Paying those extra $$$) is easy access to King County buses, Sound Transit, and Street Car. You can download the [ORCA app](https://www.myorca.com/), check bus routes, and plan your trip on the go.

**2. Walkable neighborhood**

The next best thing to accessible public transit is not having a need to use it!

In SLU, you will find yourself conveniently located from grocery stores, lush green public spaces, restaurants, cafes, and of course, endless views of the water.

There’s never a dull day in SLU when you can easily walk along Lake Union to Fremont, or dine at one of the many hip bars and cafes in Downtown.

Ditch the touristy [Kerry Park](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/kerry-park) and hike up to Queen Anne to find your own sweet spot for some stunning views of the Seattle skyline. Living in SLU means you are literally at the centre of it all.

**3. Urban jungle vibe**

With cranes perched over every corner and sky-high buildings, South Lake Union can often feel like a never-ending construction site – of hopes, dreams, and of course future of next-gen offices. Make sure you leave for work early to have some extra minutes for unwanted delays and traffic snarls.

**4. Cost of living**

One of the biggest downsides of living in Seattle is its high cost of living and the SLU area is no strange to this phenomenon. With rental prices skyrocketing year on year, a decently sized studio/one-bedroom apartment can cost anything between $1900-3000 per month. This cost only shoots up if you plan on buying a car!

**5. Proximity to parks and libraries**

From [Denny Park](https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/denny-park) to [Olympic Sculpture](https://www.seattleartmuseum.org/visit/olympic-sculpture-park), when you’re in South Lake Union, consider yourself with endless options to take some time away from the city life. As a resident of Seattle, you can also join the [Seattle Public Library](https://www.spl.org/hours-and-locations) for free!

With branches all over the city, having a library card means access to a great collection of books, DVDs, reading material, or simply some time off when you’re unsure about how to spend a lazy weekend.

**6. Homelessness**

Despite the beauty surrounding the emerald city, there are some noticeable blights. If you’re new to the Seattle area, it might be shocking to see the [extent of homelessness](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/how-many-homeless-people-are-in-king-county-depends-who-you-ask/). It is fairly normal to come across open-air drug dealings, needles on the road, tents on sidewalks with people sleeping in rugs and blankets at any time of the day.

While the SLU area is slightly better than the infamous 3rd Ave in Downtown or Capitol Hill when it comes to encounters with addicts, be cautious of any suspicious activity if you’re out late, especially in public transit!

Tip: Keep a taser handy!
