Hi,  
Iâ€™m Charvee.

Subtle Seattle was born in my small Seattle apartment in an endeavor to share information about off-beat places, nooks, and corners of this Pacific Northwest gem of a city I am beginning to call home. 

If you have anything to share about the way you see the world, feel free to get in touch or simply say hi!

Additionally, you can also find me chirping on Twitter or Instagram.
